### CSHARP-DESIGN-PATTERN

SRP - Single Responsability Principle
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change

OCP - Open Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extensions, but closed for modification

LSP - Liskov Substitution Principles
Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. 
Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S, where S is a subtype of T. (OCP and LSP works together)

ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
States that no classes/consumer should be forced to depend on methos it does not use

DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
Both should depend on abstractions. 
Abstractions should not depend on details. 
Details should depend on abstractions.
